This is a repository for React challenges from the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries certification, including:
- Random Quote Machine
- Markdown Previewer
- Drum Machine
- Calculator
- Clock

Code is deployed at [https://evasive-thumb-1234.surge.sh/](https://evasive-thumb-1234.surge.sh/)

Notes for future reference:
- create-react-app initializes git automatically
- don't create a readme.md for the github repo, it conflicts with the create-react-app readme.md with the error "Updates Rejected because the Tip of Your Current Branch is behind Its Remote Counterpart"
- the .gitignore file includes the build folder, GitHub is intended for source code so it doesn't upload by default
